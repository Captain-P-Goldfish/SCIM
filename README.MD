This is an open source implementation of the SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) protocol that is
 defined by RFC7643 and RFC7644. 

A simple description of SCIM can be found here http://www.simplecloud.info/

### Why and when you should use this library

The SCIM specification is well suited for designing resource management servers where the resources need to be
regularly updated by other remote applications.
 
**For example:**

If you create an application that uses a database configuration that might be updated by different clients or even by
just a single remote application this library is what you are looking for. It uses a standard protocol that should also
be understood by other libraries in other languages that implement the SCIM standard.

**This lib supports the full feature set of both client and server side of the SCIM specification.** 

### Documentation

for a documentation take a look into the github wiki https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM/wiki

You will find a pretty detailed explanation on how to use the server implementation here: https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM-SDK/wiki/How-to-use-the-server-implementation

And a pretty detailed explanation on how to use the client can be found here: https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM-SDK/wiki/How-to-use-the-client-implementation

**This project requires JDK 8 or higher**

**Note:**
If the project does not compile within your IDE install the "lombok" plugin for your IDE and restart it.

## Server implementation

This API is highly generic and allows the definition of your own schema representations for resources. You will even be
able to override the default User or Group core schemata if you want to. This might be useful if you do not want to 
support attributes like "*ims*", "*phoneNumbers*" etc. All you need to do is simply to write two json documents.

1. a schema definition that describes the resource you want to supply
2. a resource type definition that describes the endpoint and the additional schema extensions that may be used within
 the schema definition  

### The following features are supported

- [x] create
- [x] read
- [x] list
  * filtering (@see [additional features](https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM/wiki/Additional-Features))
  * sorting (@see [additional features](https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM/wiki/Additional-Features))

- [x] delete
- [x] bulk
  * resolving of bulkId references (@see [bulkId reference resolving](https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM/wiki/BulkId-reference-resolving))
- [x] resource versioning (@see [resource versioning](https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM-SDK/wiki/Resource-versioning))
- [x] attributes-parameter
- [x] excludedAttributes-parameter

for any registered resource

### Additional supported features

- [x] authentication for specific endpoints 
(@see [authentication](https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM-SDK/wiki/Authentication-and-Authorization#authentication))
- [x] authorization for specific endpoints 
(@see [authorization](https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM-SDK/wiki/Authentication-and-Authorization#authorization))
- [x] attribute validation (@see [attribute validation](https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM-SDK/wiki/Attribute-validation)) 

## Client implementation

The client implementation supports the following SCIM requests

- [x] create
- [x] read
- [x] list
- [x] update
- [x] delete
- [x] bulk
- [x] patch

there is also direct native support for easy use of basic authentication and X509 client authentication. All other
authentication types must be implemented manually.
